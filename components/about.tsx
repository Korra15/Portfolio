        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Accounting</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.

      I am Ayushi Parikh, a Btech student majoring in Computer science and engineering at MIT ADT University. Computers have always fascinated me, how some tiny chips can compute such complex computations in just a few seconds. This fascination is what ignited my passion towards Games and Artificial intelligence. How a small idea can be shaped into something so engrossing and informative, a single line of code turned into something life-changing. Playing sports namely football, karate is what helps me keep my brain active, alongwith travelling and exploring that help me connect to the world. Blogging about my experiences and adventures is my way of giving back to the community.

        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">history and philosophy</span>. I'm also
        learning how to play the guitar.
